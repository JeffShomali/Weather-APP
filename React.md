###### Run the Express
1. Create `package.json` file with -> `npm init`  
2. Install Express with this `npm install express@4 --save` --save option is saving express dependency into packaje.json and later in other machine can install easily install all the dependencies with `npm install` command
3. Creating `server.js` file on root and add express `.listen()` method to listen *public* folder index.html file
4. Start the server with `node server.js`


###### Hello React
1. Include 3 scripts into head : `bable`(covert JSX into Javascript), `react` and `react-dom`
2. Create a `App` container and create script tag with `text/babel` attribute
3. Create a file in public folder and call it `app.jsx` and use `reactDOM.render()` method to display on the screen
4. Import into footer with `src="app.jsx"`
5. Run the server again `node server.js`

###### First React Component
1. Add `React.createClass()` and `render` and `return` into App.jsx
2. Passing Components into `ReactDOM.render(<MyComponet.> ...)`

###### Learning JSX
1. Practicing JSX in [babeljs.io/repl/](http://babeljs.io/repl/)
     When using JSX no need to use `react.createElement()` because Babel compiling JSX
###### Component Properties (Props)
1. *Passing* props into components  just pass it into the `<Components name="Jeff"/>` or use JS expression `{}` for passing initiated value `(var val = "Jeff")`

2. *Access* before return function within React.createClass() by using `var name = this.props.name;` and use JS expression `{propname}` in render\return method.
3. Use default value in case if props not passed into component by using `getDefaultProps: function (){}`

###### User Events & Callbacks (Form)
1. *Accessing passed form* values
- create a function within component and name `onButtonClick: function (e){e.preventDefault();}` prevent default submitting.
- Add `ref="passing Value"` *ref* is like `ID` into field and `onSubmit={this.onButtonClick}` event listener into our form
- Get the values within function `var name = this.refs.name.value`

###### State (Form)
*props* vs *state* both are using for accessing data. Props used for passing  initialized data to component, but state used for not initialized data like getting form values, and use for maintained components values. Components shouldn't update props, but it updating state. Basically state updating initialized props.

1. *Accessing* passed form values by using `getInitialState()` its similar to getDefaultProps, but instead of using this.props.name in component/render function we should use `this.state.name` to fetch the value.
2. Then use `this.setState({})` to update initiated props value and render parts of component.
3. Clear the form after submitted by adding `this.refs.name.value = '';` into event handling function.

###### Nested Component
1. Create another component like level one
2. Pass it into the main app component (`App.jsx render`) method
3. Passing form value to another component:
- add event handler on form component like `<form onSubmit={this.onFormSubmit}>` then access to data inside created function, int his case `onFormSubmit: function (e){}` then validate data and lastly passing into parent component handling method in this case `handleNewName` and use `setState` to change the props value.

###### Webpack
*Why Webpack ?*
- Issue:
     1. inside `head` tag of `index.html`, browser need to request a lots of third party dependencies, so increase time to load the requests. In other way we could use `npm`
     2. Inside `app.jsx` we use a lot of jsx and es6 feature and convert them into regular javascript live inside the browser, so this makes a lot of time consuming.
     3. We can seprate the components into different files

- Install Webpack:
     1. Install webpack globally: `sudo npm install -g webpack@1.12.13`. Test it `webpack -h`
     2. Install react and react-dom  *dependencies* (our things we want when we run on production) into project's package.json: `npm install --save react@0.14.7 react-dom@0.14.7`
     3. Install webpack, babel, babel loader, babel preset, and babel preset react *dev dependencies* (only for local development) into project package.json: `npm install --save-dev webpack@1.12.13 babel-core@6.5.1 babel-loader@6.2.2 babel-preset-es2015@6.5.0 babel-preset-react@6.5.0` .Basically we tel npm not install this in other machine.
- Generating Our Bundle (Seperate components)
     1. First remove the script requests from index.html and rename `<script type="text/babel" src="app.jsx"></script>` into `<script src="bundle.js"></script>`. bundle.js created by webpack.
     2. Create `app.js` inside public diroctery and add some vanilla JS function.
     3. Run webpack: `webpack ./public/app.js ./public/bundle.js`
     4. Create components folder in public directory and create `AnyComponents.js` file and export it with `module.exports`
     5. Imported into app.js file with `require()` method.
     6. Run webpack again (step 3) and run the server again

- webpack config
     React help us to modualize our application.
     1. Creating `webpack.config.js`file in root and use entry and output methods to configure webpack server.
     2. Run the server on terminal with `webpack` and run local server with `node server.js` so all the components concat in one file that us `bundle.js`
     3. *Adding Loaders:*  adding Babel loader & JSX Support to webpack config file. Basically, Babel loader takes our files parse them  to react and run them as ES2015.
     4. Require `react` and `react-dom` in our application `App.jsx `.
     5. Adding default root with `root` and `alias` for require without specified path.
     6. Run the `webpack -w` for listening to all changes and rebundle automatically, but need to run npm server.js in different terminal tab.

# Weather App (react-router)
- Install `react-router` dependency:`npm install react-router@2.0.0 --save`
- Initiate `Route` to `react-router` and load all modules
- Pass React Router to main render
- Define indivitiual route
- Create `Main` component in app/components/ directory and load it in app/app.jsx
- Create `alias` for Main components in webpack config file before load it in App.js after created alias run the server with `webpack` command.
- Create some other components like `About` and `Weather` and `examples` and then make alias for them and update webpack with `webpack -w`
for more about [react-router]("https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router")

*Why <Link>*
- Why should use `<Link to="/examples">Examples</Link>` instead of `<a href="#/">Some Link Here </a>` ? Because have extra handy features like adding  more stile into the link to customer know which page they are on.
ex: `<IndexLink to="/" activeClassName="active" activeStyle={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>Get Weather</IndexLink>
>`
